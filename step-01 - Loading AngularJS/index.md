# Step 1 - Loading AngularJS
Before we can use AngularJS to create an application we need to load it into the browser.  We do
this using a `<script>` element:

```html
<script src="angular.js"></script>
```

This element tells the browser to download and run the `angular.js` JavaScript file.

>You can get the `angular.js` file from http://code.angularjs.org/.

We place this `<script>` tag in the `<head>` tag or at the bottom of the `<body>` tag. Once the
script is loaded we are ready to make our app.  We do this by adding directives to the HTML.
